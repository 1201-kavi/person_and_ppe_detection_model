# person_and_ppe_detection_model
 Overview
This package includes scripts and models for person detection and PPE detection using YOLOv8. The steps below guide you on how to run the scripts effectively.

How to Run the Scripts
1. Setup Environment:
    Create a Python environment and activate it.
    Install the necessary dependencies, including PyTorch and the appropriate CUDA version (used CUDA 12.4 in this project).

2. Run Scripts:
   Model Training:
      It is recommended to run the training scripts in the command prompt to avoid potential GPU crashes.
   Inference and Validation:
      You can run these scripts either in your Python environment or via the command prompt.

3. Additional Files
   Predict and validation scripts are included for testing and evaluating the models. Review these files before running them.

Tips
Tip 1:Run the scripts in a `.py` file or the command prompt.
Tip 2:Model training is preferred in the command prompt to avoid GPU crashes.
Tip 3:Ensure you have the correct CUDA version installed (CUDA 12.4 was used here).
Tip 4:Install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version.
